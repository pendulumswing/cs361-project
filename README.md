# Weather Comparison App - (CS 361 Project)
Enter two U.S. locations (zip or city) to retrieve weather data 
from two sources - OpenWeather.org API and a pollen count API. A
colored graph will provide a visual comparison of the data.

### Website
https://cs361-weather-app.herokuapp.com

### Microservice
Also provides a stock price API endpoint. 
For example, a request to https://cs361-weather-app.herokuapp.com/api/stocks/NFLX,
will trigger the API server to scrape the Yahoo Finance website for the current
Netflix stock price and return that price as text in the response.

### Tech Stack
Uses React, Tailwind CSS, and Flask. Hosted on Heroku.
